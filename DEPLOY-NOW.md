## 🏃 OPTION 1: GitHub + Netlify (Recommended)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

Since I can't push directly (need your credentials), you need to do this:

#### Method A: Command Line (5 minutes)

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**

2. **Navigate to the folder:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/dartim-website
   ```
   (Or wherever you downloaded this folder)

3. **Run the push command:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. **When asked for credentials:**
   - Username: `Aoniton` (your GitHub username)
   - Password: Use a **Personal Access Token**, NOT your regular password

5. **Get a Personal Access Token:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Name it: "Dar-Tim Website"
   - Check: ✅ `repo` (all repo permissions)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - Copy the token (you won't see it again!)
   - Use THIS as your password when pushing

#### Method B: GitHub Desktop (Easiest!)

1. **Download:** https://desktop.github.com
2. **Install and sign in**
3. **Add repository:**
   - File → Add Local Repository
   - Choose the `dartim-website` folder
4. **Click "Publish repository"** or "Push origin"
5. **Done!** ✅

### Step 2: Deploy on Netlify

1. **Go to:** https://app.netlify.com
2. **Sign up/Login** (you can use GitHub account)
3. **Click:** "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
4. **Choose:** GitHub
5. **Select:** "Dar-Tim" repository
6. **Settings:**
   - Branch: `main`
   - Build command: (leave empty)
   - Publish directory: `/` or (leave empty)
7. **Click:** "Deploy site"
8. **Wait 1-2 minutes... DONE!** 🎉

## 🆘 Troubleshooting:

### "Authentication failed" (GitHub)
**Solution:** Use Personal Access Token, not password
- Get one: https://github.com/settings/tokens

### "Permission denied" (GitHub)
**Solution:** Make sure you own the repository or are a collaborator

### Site won't deploy on Netlify
**Solution:**
1. Check all files are there
2. Make sure `index.html` is in root folder
3. Try the drag-and-drop method instead

### Contact form not working
**Solution:** It uses `mailto:` - opens email client
For better solution, see `README.md` for FormSpree setup

### Quick Decision Guide:

**Choose Option 1 (GitHub + Netlify) if:**
